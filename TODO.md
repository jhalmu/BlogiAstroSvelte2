## # # New ideas
  -$2Lets add HTMX to get pages load smoother
  -$2Search bar

Run basic terminal commands by your self. Before run server again, stop it so we do not get several instanses to run.
  -$2> - put old navbar back but keep stickynavbar  !important
  -$2update todo list for new ideas
  -$2have list what you have implemented.

You can run "node generate-blog-posts.js"

For Sosial sharing:
  -$2Short text writer, name in finnish Viestimö, sends messages straight to sosialplatforms. In text field there shows mark-limits for differend sosialplatforms visual way. (backend?)
  -$2SosialSharing uses Also DEV Community.
  -$2For New Ideas: Load posts from sosialplatforms.
  -$2Write this clean and readaple form and if yo want you can correct my typos :)

Desing is very important to me and we need do
them together. The Frontpage was very good and We need to be carefully if we change it. We have to keep balance and portitions and continuence high in every page. This is important ecpecially when our www-app grows.
  -$2Lets put these files and coming in folder DevDocuments. Files can be separate like Articles, Ideas, Testing etc. Name them what  you think best.
