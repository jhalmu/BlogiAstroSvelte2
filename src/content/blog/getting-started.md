Welcome to the world of web development! In this guide, we'll explore the fundamental concepts and tools you need to get started with building modern websites.

## The Basic Building Blocks

Every website consists of three main technologies:

1. **HTML** - The structure
2. **CSS** - The styling
3. **JavaScript** - The interactivity

### HTML: The Foundation

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the basic structure of websites. It's the foundation upon which everything else is built.

```html
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

### CSS: Making Things Beautiful

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes websites look good. It handles all the visual aspects of your site.

```css
h1 {
    color: purple;
    font-size: 2rem;
}
```

### JavaScript: Adding Interactivity

JavaScript brings your website to life by adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.

```javascript
document.querySelector('h1').addEventListener('click', () => {
    alert('Hello!');
});
```

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered the basics, you can move on to:

1. Learning frameworks
2. Understanding responsive design
3. Exploring backend development
4. Practicing with real projects

Remember, the best way to learn is by doing. Start small, but start today!
