## Welcome to the world of web development! In this guide, we'll explore the fundamental concepts and tools you need to get started with building modern websites

## # The Basic Building Blocks

Every website consists of three main technologies:


1. **HTML** - The structure


1. **CSS** - The styling


1. **JavaScript** - The interactivity

## # # # ## HTML: The Foundation

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the basic structure of websites. It's the foundation upon which everything else is built.

```text
text
text
text
html
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

```text
text
text
text

## # # ## CSS: Making Things Beautiful

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes websites look good. It handles all the visual aspects of your site.

```text
text
text
text
css
h1 {
  color: purple;
  font-size: 2rem;
}

```text
text
text
text

## # # ## JavaScript: Adding Interactivity

JavaScript brings your website to life by adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.

```text
text
text
text
javascript
document.querySelector('h1').addEventListener('click', () => {
  alert('Hello!');
});

```text
text
text
text
