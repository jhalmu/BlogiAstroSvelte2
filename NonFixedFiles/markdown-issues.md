# Markdown Issues Log

## # Current Status

All markdown formatting issues in the docs directory have been automatically fixed. The fix-markdown.js script handles:
  -$2Blank lines around headings
  -$2Blank lines around lists
  -$2Blank lines around code blocks
  -$2Multiple consecutive blank lines
  -$2File ending with single newline

## # # Potential Manual Review Needed

The following aspects might need manual review as they cannot be automatically fixed:


1. Content accuracy after formatting fixes


1. Complex markdown structures like nested lists


1. Table formatting


1. Image references and links


1. Code block language specifications

## # # How to Fix Remaining Issues


1. Run the automatic fix:

```text
text
bash
   node scripts/fix-markdown.js

```text
text


1. Verify formatting with markdownlint:

```text
text
bash
   npx markdownlint "docs/**/*.md"

```text
text


1. Manually review files for:
  -$2Correct content flow after formatting

  -$2Valid links and references
  -$2Appropriate code block language tags

## # # Next Steps


1. Regular validation of markdown files using the validate script
